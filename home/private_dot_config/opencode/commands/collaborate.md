Load the `collaborative-design` skill, then work with the user to explore and converge on a solution.

Topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Examples
- `/collaborate how should we structure the new caching layer?`
- `/collaborate what's the best approach for error handling here?`
- `/collaborate I need to add a feature but not sure where to start`

## What This Does
1. Restates your objective to confirm understanding
2. Identifies unknowns and assumptions
3. Presents 2-4 options with tradeoffs
4. Recommends an approach
5. Waits for your input before proceeding

## Output
Produces an "Agreed Spec" with scope, non-goals, approach, and acceptance criteria when collaboration converges.
