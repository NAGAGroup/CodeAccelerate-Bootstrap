# Repository Assessment Summary

## Structure and Management

- Your dotfiles are managed with **chezmoi**, a dotfile manager that helps keep
  configurations consistent across multiple machines
- The repository is structured with the home directory as the root for chezmoi
  (specified in `.chezmoiroot`)
- **Pixi** is used for cross-platform package management, providing a rootless
  way to install development tools

## Core Components

1. **Shell Environment**:

   - Using Nushell as the primary shell for both Windows and Linux
   - Configured with minimal settings in `config.nu` and `env.nu`
   - Includes automatic completions for pixi and other tools

1. **Neovim Setup**:

   - Based on LazyVim framework
   - Extensive configuration for C++ development
   - Includes AI features (Copilot and CodeCompanion integration)
   - TabbyML integration for local AI models

1. **Cross-Platform Support**:

   - Dedicated bootstrap scripts for both Windows (`bootstrap.bat`) and Linux
     (`bootstrap.sh`)
   - Platform-specific configuration via templating in chezmoi
   - Windows-specific symlink creation for compatibility

1. **Development Tools**:

   - GCC toolchain for both platforms
   - CMake, Python, Git, Ninja and other essential tools
   - Zellij terminal multiplexer (Linux only)

## Installation Process

1. Uses pixi for package management
1. Installs nushell and chezmoi globally
1. Runs platform-specific setup scripts
