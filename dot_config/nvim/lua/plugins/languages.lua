-- Language-specific plugins and configurations

local add = MiniDeps.add

-- This module is primarily for language-specific tooling beyond LSP/format/lint
-- Most language support is already configured in core/lsp.lua, core/formatting.lua, core/linting.lua

-- Additional language-specific configurations can be added here as needed
-- For now, the core language support is complete via the core modules
